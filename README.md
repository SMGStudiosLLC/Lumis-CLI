# Lumis CLI

> The intelligent, autonomous terminal agent.
> *Designed by Tobias Schmidt Services LLC.*

Lumis CLI is a sophisticated command-line environment that transforms your terminal into an agentic workspace. It combines the power of top-tier cloud models and local inference with deep system integration, allowing for autonomous file manipulation, code generation, and complex task execution. And best of all, it's free!

## Features

### Refined Terminal UI
Built with a focus on aesthetics and usability, Lumis features a polished interface with syntax highlighting, smooth shimmering animations during inference, and intuitive arrow-key navigation menus.

### Autonomous Agent Tools
Lumis goes beyond chat. It is equipped with a robust toolset allowing it to:
* **Read & Write Files:** intelligently handles large files via line-range reading.
* **Surgical Edits:** performs find-and-replace or line-patching operations to modify code.
* **System Execution:** runs shell commands and lists directories to navigate your machine.
* **Visual Planning:** creates and manages interactive TODO lists for multi-step complex tasks.

### Dual-Mode Intelligence
* **Cloud Mode:** connects to **Poe** for access to premium models like Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2 Codex, and Gemini 3 Pro.
* **Local Mode:** integrates seamlessly with **Ollama** for private, offline inference.

### Experimental Features
* **Reasoning Mode:** activates deep thinking protocols for complex logic problems.
* **Smart Planning:** forces the model to visualize its strategy before execution.
* **Verbose Output:** reveals the model's internal thought process and verification steps.
